# Zeller React Native Client App

## Features
- Displays a list of users that are returned by the listZellerCustomers query. The graphql schema you will need, and the connection details can be found in aws-exports.js and schema.gql.
- Has a list of selectable user types that include Admin and Manager. Selecting a user type should perform a query against listZellerCustomers using that user type as a filter.
- Runs on iOS or android and Web.
- Designs for the user feature includes a drawers style navigation.

## Bonus Points

These features are absolutely not required, however if you finish your project eary and wish to continue, here are some ideas

- Implemented App navigation with a second, empty homescreen
